## Hmmmm
* Seems like we just need to scan through the BST and add the values of each node to an array?
* make a function called "BuildPreorder" that takes a root and an array of ints
    * I _think_ we can make the array pass by reference?
    * if not, lets just do left/right and concatenate
* Call the function recursively until the root is null?
