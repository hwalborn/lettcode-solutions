## Starting
There's always 1 way

Maybe think like start out by doing something like this for a 4 stepper

1 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 1 + 1
2 + 2
1 + 2

So, start with 2, add ones, then add two 2's then ones, then three 2's, then ones, until you have the number of steps
Then move the two over so it's 1 + 2 plus 1's
repeat

This doesn't fully work, for instance a 6 stepper

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 2

It's leaving out two other possiblities:
2 + 1 + 2 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 2
